# Gesture Lab 

A **real-time web app** that tracks two hands using **MediaPipe** and a webcam.  
It visualizes **thumb–index finger distance**, **hand openness**, and recognizes **gestures** like 👍 Thumbs Up, ✌️ Peace, 👌 OK, ✊ Fist, 🖐️ Open, etc.  

The project runs entirely in the browser with **HTML + JavaScript** (no backend needed).
